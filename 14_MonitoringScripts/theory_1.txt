✅ Lesson 17 — Monitoring Scripts (Disk, Memory, Services)

🧠 What Is a Monitoring Script?

A monitoring script:

checks a system resource

compares it to a threshold

prints/logs a warning or OK message

can later be hooked to cron or alerts

Examples:

disk almost full

memory low

service not running
